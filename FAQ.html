			If the order has to be left at the security gate, please continue to pay online via wallets, UPI, net banking, or cards as you are doing now.<br>
			If you choose COD as the payment method, you will need to pay our delivery executive in cash at the time of delivery.<br>

		</li>
		<p>
			Once you are done selecting your products and click on checkout you will be prompted to select delivery slot. Your order will be delivered to you on the day and slot selected by you.

			<h4>How are the fruits and herbs packaged?</h4>
		</li>
		<p>
			Fresh fruits and herbs are hand picked and hand cleaned. We ensure hygienic and careful handling of all our products.
		</p>
		<li>
			<h4>How are the fruits and herbs weighed?</h4>
		</li>
		<p>
			Every fruit and herb varies a little in size and weight. While you shop we show an estimated weight and price for everything priced by kilogram. At the time of delivery we weigh each item to determine final price. This could vary by 10% at maximum. Therefore if you have shopped for something that costs Rs. 100 per kg, and we delivery 1.5 kg of the product to you (eg apple, pineapple), you will still be charged a maximum of Rs. 110. In case the weight of the product is lesser than what you ordered, you will pay correspondingly less.

			<h4>What is the minimum order for delivery?</h4>
		</li>

			There is no minimum order for delivery but we charge a nominal delivery fee.
