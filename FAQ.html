			How are the fruits and herbs weighed?
		</li>
		<p>
			Every fruit and herb varies a little in size and weight. While you shop we show an estimated weight and price for everything priced by kilogram. At the time of delivery we weigh each item to determine final price. This could vary by 10% at maximum. Therefore if you have shopped for something that costs Rs. 100 per kg, and we delivery 1.5 kg of the product to you (eg apple, pineapple), you will still be charged a maximum of Rs. 110. In case the weight of the product is lesser than what you ordered, you will pay correspondingly less.
